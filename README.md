# RAF

An Apollo GraphQL example using React and FakerQl.

## Motivation

[FakerQL](https://fakerql.com) is a hosted **GraphQL** endpoint that allows you to send queries, mutations and subscriptions for totally fake data. In this case I'll use it for testing **Apollo client** along with **React.js**. The login and register mutations return a **JWT** which is great for applications that require authentication.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

The project is created to build a modern React application:

* React 16.3
* Webpack and React Router 4
* Apollo client 2.2
* Server Side Rendering
* Code Spliting (by Vendor and Routes) (working in)
* Live Reload (without browser extension)
* Bundle Analizer (comming soon)
* Linter with prettier and eslint (airbnb's config)

## Getting started

Run the following script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if you prefer Yarn

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Tests

```bash
yarn lint
```

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

## Building RAF

Just make sure your lints are okay :D
